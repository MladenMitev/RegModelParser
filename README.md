	</li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul> 
  <li>Easy to undersand.</li>
  <li>You can write a very complicated logic in few word.</li>
	<li>RegModel is very light and much faster technology compared to regular expressions.</li>
	<li>RegModel use small memory and have small footprint.</li>
  <li>RegModel is faser 200-300% then regular expression. Because RegModel not need to compile pattern.</li>
